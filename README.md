Methodology:
Data Collection
Gather data from reliable sources such as:
Courses of Study documents, The BSW Website, Professorsâ€™ web pages, Inception(fresher's magazine).

AI Integration:
We have used LLM APIs like Groq for generating intelligent responses.
We have built a vector database with Qdrant for efficient context retrieval.

Workflow:
Cloud setup on Qdrant.
Make a vector database in Qdrant.
Use the RAG (Retrieve and Generate) approach to retreive the top 5 most relevant chunks of text.
Pass the context to the LLM to generate concise and relevant answers.
Display the output of the llm to the user on the app.
Implement a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

Code Structure:
The pdf's taken to manage the database are preprocessed by using "Preprocessing.py" file
Then we add into our DataBase by using "DBMS.py" file
We make the functioning our bot into a user friendly web and mobile app with the help of Stramlit.
